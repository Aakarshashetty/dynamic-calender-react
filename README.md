### Fetching Timeslots
The application fetches available timeslots from a mock API endpoint. When the app loads, it makes a GET request to the endpoint, and the available timeslots are displayed in the calendar.

### Selecting a Date

- Available timeslots for the selected date will be displayed.
### Booking an Appointment

- A booking confirmation step is not required for this assignment.
### React Best Practices
- Functional components and hooks are used for clean and modular code.
- State is managed effectively using React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`.
### Optional Features

- Responsive design ensures the UI looks good on both mobile and desktop views.
